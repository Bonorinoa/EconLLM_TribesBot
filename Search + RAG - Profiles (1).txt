Hazda


The Hadza are a modern human population residing in northern Tanzania, Africa. They are known for their unique lifestyle which closely resembles that of Paleolithic humans. The majority (>90\%) of their subsistence still comes from hunting and gathering, making them one of the last remaining societies to live this way. They are organized into camps, with the Dedauko and Sengele camps being mentioned in the context.In terms of culture, the Hadza language, known as 'hazane' or 'as the people', plays a significant role. They refer to themselves as the 'hazabee' or 'people'. Their culture also includes a strong tradition of sharing, as all foods gathered or hunted are brought back to camp and shared among the community. The economic system of the Hadza is largely based on subsistence hunting and gathering. They do not seem to engage in commercial activities or trade, and their survival depends on the resources available in their immediate environment. This includes hunting for game and gathering plant fibers, particularly from tubers. The text does not provide information on the political ideologies of the Hadza. However, given their lifestyle and social organization, it is likely that their political system, if any, is largely informal and based on consensus or the influence of elder or more experienced members of the community. The values of the Hadza seem to revolve around communal living and sharing. They live in close-knit communities and share the fruits of their hunting and gathering efforts. The text suggests that there may be some division of labor based on sex, but this seems to be a practical arrangement rather than a rigid social hierarchy. The kinship system of the Hadza is not explicitly described in the text. However, the mention of 'young Hadza' and 'parents' suggests that they have family structures. It is likely that these family ties play a significant role in their social organization. Their social organization appears to be relatively egalitarian, with men and women both contributing to the community's subsistence. However, there may be some division of labor based on sex, with men and women consuming slightly more of the foods they themselves gather or hunt. The Hadza live in camps, suggesting a form of communal living where resources are shared and decisions are likely made collectively.

Tsimane


The Tsimané are an indigenous people who live in the Bolivian Amazon. They live a pre-industrial lifestyle that includes farming, hunting, gathering, and fishing. This lifestyle keeps them extremely physically active. Their diet is high in fiber and healthy fats from fish, lean meats, and vegetables, with few preservatives. The Tsimané culture is deeply rooted in their subsistence lifestyle. Their daily activities revolve around hunting, gathering, fishing, and farming. They have maintained these traditions for generations, providing valuable insights into the health benefits of a hunter-forager-farmer lifestyle. The Tsimané's cultural values emphasize physical activity and a diet low in saturated fats, which has contributed to their robust health, despite having little or no access to modern healthcare. The economic system of the Tsimané is primarily based on subsistence farming, hunting, gathering, and fishing. They do not rely on a monetary system as much as industrialized societies. Instead, their economy is based on the direct extraction and production of goods from their natural environment. The political ideologies of the Tsimané are not explicitly mentioned in the context provided. However, given their traditional lifestyle, it can be inferred that their political system may be based on tribal leadership or communal decision-making structures, typical of many indigenous societies. The Tsimané's values are deeply intertwined with their lifestyle and survival strategies. They value physical activity, a healthy diet, and a strong community. These values contribute to their overall health and longevity, despite the high levels of inflammation they experience due to frequent infections and parasites. Kinship and social organization among the Tsimané are likely to be based on familial ties and communal living. Their lifestyle requires cooperation and shared responsibilities, suggesting a strong sense of community. This social organization and their kinship ties help them to survive and thrive in their environment. Despite their lack of access to modern healthcare, the Tsimané have some of the healthiest hearts in the world and experience brain aging at a slower rate than their peers in industrialized nations. This has led researchers to use the Tsimané as a baseline for healthy brain aging and heart health.

Ache


The Aché are an indigenous people of Paraguay, with a total population of around 1,500. They are hunter-gatherers living in eastern Paraguay and are known for their nomadic lifestyle. From the earliest Jesuit accounts of the Aché in the 17th century until their peaceful outside contacts in the 20th century, the Aché were described as nomadic hunter-gatherers living in small bands and depending entirely on wild forest resources for subsistence. This lifestyle is deeply rooted in their culture and has had a significant impact on their social organization. Their culture is rich and distinct. The Aché language provides clues to their origin. It has a Tupí-Guaraní lexicon, overlaid on a unique grammar structure not found in sister Guaraní languages. Early descriptions of the Aché emphasized their white skin, light eye and hair color, beards, and Asiatic features as identifying characteristics. Their subsistence practices and technology were considered extremely simple, and nomadism made them secretive and evasive. The Aché economic system is primarily based on hunting and gathering. In the 20th century, four different ethnolinguistic populations of Aché were contacted and pacified: the Northern Aché, the Yvytyruzu Aché, the Ypety Aché, and the Ñacunday Aché. Each of these populations was an endogamous dialectal group, consisting of multiple residential bands, with no peaceful interaction between the groups. Regarding political ideologies, the Aché suffered repeated abuses by rural Paraguayan colonists, ranchers, and big landowners from the conquest period until the latter half of the 20th century. Under military dictator Alfredo Stroessner, the Northern Aché, who had been the only inhabitants of nearly 20,000 square kilometers of rural Paraguay, ended up confined on just two reservations totaling little more than 50 square kilometers of titled land. This process was specifically carried out to pacify them, and to remove them from their ancestral homeland. The Aché's values are deeply rooted in their traditional tribal religion. They have a strong sense of kinship, with their society organized into small bands. These bands are endogamous, meaning they only marry within their own group. This has helped the Aché maintain their unique culture and language, despite outside influences. Their social organization is primarily based on these small bands. Each group is independent and there is little interaction between different groups. However, within each band, there is a high level of cooperation and sharing, particularly when it comes to food acquisition. This cooperative behavior is a key aspect of Aché social organization and is a testament to their strong sense of community and kinship.

Men who own a large number of cattle have special recognition in their communities, indicating a form of social hierarchy. Their society is also organized around Islamic religious practices, as the Orma converted to Islam three or four generations ago and are now almost exclusively Muslim.
